                <p>On a clear, chilly night, as foreign to Atlanta as the man who was inside, Jake Deerin stood within a Georgia Tech dorm room. Flabbergasted. Stupified. Stumped.</p>
                <p>He was trying to think of a name for his new website</p>
                <p>After a moment's thought, he said, "Ducks will do." And thus did this site come to be.</p>
                <p>Since October 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2016, we've provided the fiction of sending you premium tub-raised ducklings straight to your home, swimming pool, and marshes (was a pleasure, Hermit Walters!). Overpriced but always on time, our customer loves our proven business model based on the old-time values of quality and imagination. We're perfect for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pool Parties</li>
                    <li>Lifeguard Rallies</li>
                    <li>Weddings</li>
                    <li>Prison Bar Mitzvahs</li>
                    <li>Royal Coronations</li>
                    <li>Pet Funerals</li>
                    <li><i>...and probably much, much more!</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>So remember, the next time you're about to blow money on that next gadget craze, ask yourself: am I happy? Is this really what I crave? Will this really fill the hole in my life? Because the answer is no. No, it isn't. No, it will not.</p>
                <p>I mean, neither will we, but if you'd like to still buy a duck, that would be cool.</p>
